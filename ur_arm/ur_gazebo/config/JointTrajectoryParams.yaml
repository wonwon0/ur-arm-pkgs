  # set to true to use angle poses in a trajectory to control the device. If this is false,

  # velocities are used instead. 
  use_angle_poses: true 
 
  # Instead of sending a bunch of trajectory points in advance and then wait the alloted time for the trajectory,
  # trajectory velocities are controlled *during* trajectory execution. This is more accurate, but yields in a less
  # smooth trajectory on the real arm. If this is set true, use_angle_poses value is forced to false.
  use_online_control: false 
  
  # tolerance (in radians) for a joint to be considered at target angle
  goal_angles_tolerance: 0.015
  
  # complementary to goal_angles_tolerance: tolerance of intermediate trajectory points to achieve during execution of trajectory. 
  # This only applies when online trajectory execution control is performed (use_online_trajectory_control).
  # It is ensured that each trajectory point is met with this accuracy. The smaller this tolerance,the more jerky the trajectory 
  # execution might be, but the more accurate as well. If this is > goal_angles_tolerance,
  # at the end of trajectory execution a correction might be done to meet the desired end accuracy.
  goal_angles_intermediate_tolerance: 0.03
  
  # for trajectory execution, this is the angle (in radian) which two joint positions may be apart
  # in the trajectory, or the execution is rejected due to safety reasons. Setting this to -1 disables
  # the safety limitation.
